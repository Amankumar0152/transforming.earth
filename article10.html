            <h1>Target Plant 1 Trillions Tree? How it will happen! Is this possible?</h1>
            <p>Estimates for the number of trees needed to offset carbon emissions vary, but some suggest planting a trillion trees could capture up to 1012 billion tons of CO2 once mature. A 2015 paper calculated that 1.2 trillion trees could absorb a decade's worth of carbon emissions. However, a 2019 paper suggested that only 1 trillion trees could fit on 2.2 million acres of available land, though the definition of "available" has been contested.

                How Do Trees Affect Climate Change? | TIME
                18 Oct 2022 — Forest protection and tree planting projects predate the idea of net-zero: The ...
                Planting trees is one of the most effective ways to combat climate change, but it's not a simple solution. Some say that planting 50 million tree saplings in India would need to be replicated 800 times to cancel out human-created CO2. Others say that planting a forest the size of New Mexico each year would be needed to offset American emissions. 
                Some studies suggest planting the right trees is important, with broadleaved species like oak, beech, and maple being most effective because their larger leaf surface area increases photosynthesis. Conifers, on the other hand, absorb more heat. 
                Planting trees isn't enough to solve climate change, and some say cutting methane emissions is the quickest way to limit global warming before 2030.
